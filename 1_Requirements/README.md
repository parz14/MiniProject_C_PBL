# Requirements

## Introduction

* The main motive of this project is to understand and apply the learning of C and System / Software development life cycle (SDLC), In order to create projects with code features like: readable, portable, less prone to errors, easy to extend the features, adherence to coding standards and industry best practices.

* This project uses **data file handling** concepts of C programming to generate reciepts / invoices from a sample template based on some information required as user input. Large documentations with repeated entity values can be easily generated using this application of C language.

* *This project doesn't add or enhances any feature of existing application / utility / algorithm etc. It's just an application of programming concepts for learning purposes.*

### About Data File Handling

On an abstract level, a file is a collection of bytes stored on a storage device, which is generally a disk or other storage device. The collection of bytes may be interpreted, for example, as characters, words, lines, paragraphs and pages from a textual document; fields and records belonging to a database; or pixels from a graphical image. The meaning of the file is determined by the data structures and operations used by a program to process the file.
